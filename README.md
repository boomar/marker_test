This is an art experiment, using AR

What are these?
Political / editiorial comics, reflecting and commenting on news events and daily events.
But exploring the aesthetics of AR (big interest)

Title: PM relaxes at Chequers country estate while UK death toll rises by 759

I am using AR.js as an interesting way of reflecting and commenting on the Covid-19 crisis. I am experimenting with the aesthetics of AR - there are lots of creative possibilities eg revealing what's hidden.

These montages (poetically and through association and imagination) suggest a meaning or social comment. The juxtaposition  allows viewers to make their own conclusions. Without needing to be too explicit.

I call these "AR Miniatures" or "AR Vignettes" or "Political Miniatures" - each one creates a tiny world, and makes a comment on the news. They could be look on as a new storytelling format.

Each of these is a 3-dimensional montage/ aesthetic experiment.

In this example, we see PM Johnson walk with his girlfriend through the wild flowers at his country estate (Chequers).

A plane carrying PPE flies past above, in the distance, unnoticed.

Countryside and flowers, birds singing.

PM blissfully disiniterested/ unconcerned in the thousands of deaths around him.

The overall effect I want to communicate is cavalier incompetence over the Covid-19 outbreak.
